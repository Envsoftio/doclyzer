# Story 5.14: Emergency Containment Actions with Mandatory Audit Notes

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a superadmin,
I want emergency containment with required notes,
so that urgent response remains accountable.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given emergency action is executed, when completion occurs, then mandatory audit notes are captured.
2. Given missing note content, when emergency action is attempted, then request is rejected before execution.
3. Given high-impact actions, when executed, then secondary confirmation and elevated privilege checks are enforced.
4. Given post-incident review, when retrieving records, then emergency notes and action timeline are queryable and immutable.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Define API/domain contracts and error codes for this story
  - [ ] Add or extend module types/DTOs and controller routes with stable response envelopes
  - [ ] Ensure role checks and correlation IDs are enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] Task 2: Implement service and persistence logic using existing architecture patterns
  - [ ] Use TypeORM repositories via dependency injection and injected repositories
  - [ ] Keep business rules deterministic and idempotent for retriable operations
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate UI/consumer surface for superadmin workflows (API-first if UI not scaffolded)
  - [ ] Add route-level stubs/contracts in web/admin surface plan when implementation surface is pending
  - [ ] Ensure output states are explicit (pending/success/failure/reverted)
- [ ] Task 4: Add audit and governance protections
  - [ ] Emit auditable events for actor/action/target/time/outcome
  - [ ] Apply PHI-safe telemetry and logging guardrails
- [ ] Task 5: Validate manually (no automated tests per project policy)
  - [ ] Record manual QA checklist and edge cases in completion notes

## Dev Notes

- Story focus files/modules: apps/api/src/modules (new audit_incident), apps/api/src/modules/account, apps/api/src/modules/sharing
- Keep domain separation from architecture baseline: PHI-bearing clinical/report domain must stay isolated from billing/entitlement and admin analytics domains.
- Follow project context rules: no direct environment reads inside modules; use ConfigService, keep thin controllers and service-owned business logic.
- Enforce superadmin access controls with explicit guards; avoid introducing global auth shortcuts.
- Keep telemetry and logs PHI-safe: do not include PHI payloads in audit/search/analytics streams.

### Project Structure Notes

- Primary backend surface: apps/api/src/modules (extend current modules; introduce analytics_admin and audit_incident only when needed by this story).
- Entity and migration changes live under apps/api/src/database/entities and apps/api/src/database/migrations.
- Web admin surface target (when scaffolded): apps/web/pages/admin and apps/web/server/api/admin.
